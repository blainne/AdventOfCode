This repo contains my solutions to [Advent Of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017)

Few comments:
- My goal was not to compete with others. The code was written slowly.
- Main focus was on practicing F# and trying to get readable code.
- Few solutions are working horribly slow, but I decided to leave them as they are.
